# LinkEngine
LinkEngine is hybrid game engine written on C#, based on Unity (with weak binding, possible to work with other engines). You can write a game like in MonoGame/XNA, only you control engine lifecycle. Clean code, just and easy to understand, good OOD with minimum dynamic/functional paradigms. There is an entry point!
